Currently if you have an automatically installed package A (= 1) where

and you upgrade B from 1 to 2; then  you can:

If A was installed by a chain initiated by Recommends (say X Rec Y, Y Depends A), the solver sometimes preferred removing A (and anything depending on it until it got).]]></description>

If a crash occurs while updating a file, the file either contains the old

This crate essentially solves the following problem: when you update a file,

close it. The problem with this process is that if a crash occurs at any point

      <description><![CDATA[There we were starting discussions for the Ubuntu Developer Summit at the end of October in Copenhagen and wondering who we could afford to send when I got a nice e-mail asking what it would cost to send everyone who wanted to go.  I replied with a rough budget of what the flights and hotel would be and next thing I know that amount had appeared in my Paypal account.  Now I like to think Kubuntu is a friendly and trusting community but this is generosity beyond my expectations.  I'm constantly a...]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Thanks to Alan Bell for organising a wonderful Christmas dinner at Dans Le Noir last night. It was a wonderful venue and the food was amazing. I never realised how dark, dark could really be.
I would recommend this restaurant to anybody.  Also remember, this is the only restaurant  where you can get away with eating with your fingers and licking your plate when you are finished. As it is so dark, who would ever know.
I was however, slightly disappointed that some of the other members of the podc...]]></description>

This session was to create a way to monitor bugs across several packages and in an efficient way. Currently, most people who want to work on bugs of multiple packages create a team and subscribe all packages to this team. It’s working to get information, but nothing exist to summarize statistics about the bugs...]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[We had quite a successful Ubuntu Global Jam on Saturday. Thanks Yola for hosting us. It was only 5 of us, and I was the only one with any uploads under my belt, but the nice small team meant I had time to help everyone fix some build failures. We had intended to focus on Scientific packages, but it was easier to just pick arbitrary build failures from the most recent archive rebuild.

Maia visited us briefly at lunch time and took some photos, thanks :) Sorry you couldn&#8217;t stay longer.

The Puppet Masters are only responsible for compiling catalogs requested by Puppet Agents - they don't act as CA themselves. They only accept Puppet Agents which certificates have been issued by the Puppet Master CA.

The Puppet Agent retrieves their certificates from the Puppet Master CA the first time they run. They c...]]></description>

Here in Andalusia, at the south of Spain, every computer (400.000+) at the schools runs «software libre» thanks to the commitment made by the regional government 7 years ago. Specifically, we run Guadalinex Edu, a base of Ubuntu with a lot of free educational applications in the top.
